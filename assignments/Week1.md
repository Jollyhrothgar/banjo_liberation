## Review Concepts

For your own reading / understading, read up a little bit about the following, and describe in one sentence what you think it does:

1.   Distributed Version Control (Git)
   *    YOUR ANSWER HERE
2.   Python Virtual Environment (Anaconda)
   *    YOUR ANSWER HERE
3.   Python Functions
   *    Write a python function that prints out "Banjo Master" if you give it the name "Ricky" and "Grasshopper" if you give it the name "Mike". Put this function in a new jupyter notebook that you check in to the repository in the "scratch" directory.
4.   Review the commands we used today. Try using the command: `man ls` or `man git` to read comman-line documentation. In one sentence, what do they do?
   *   `cd`:
   *   `ls`:
      *   `-a`:
      *   `-l`:
   *   `mkdir`:
   *   `ls`:
   *   `cd`:  
   *   `git`:
      *   `log`:
      *   `commit`:
      *   `push`:
      *   `pull`:
5.   Basic vim
   *   How do you open a file in vim?
   *   How do you enter "edit mode" in vim?
   *   How do you enter "command mode" in vim?
   *   How do you save a file?
   *   How do you quit vim?
6.   How do you install a new python package in conda? Try to install `sklearn` in your `banjo` environment.
7.   How do you create a new python environment in conda?
8.   How do you change python environments in conda?

### Coding

*   Check out the latest version of 'Banjo_Liberation_Mystic_Rolls.ipynb' from this repository.
   *   You may need to do a sequence of `git commit` `git push` and `git pull` to get everything synced. Don't worry, you can't break it.
*   Run each cell of the notebook to confirm  your environment is set up correctly.
*   Modify one of the roll generator functions to generate bob-dobalina style roles
    *   Challanges: How are you going to represent "don't play" in the fingering lists?
    *   Challenges: Do you have to add new rules?
*   Create a new notebook in the "notebooks" directory. Do some research on what python modules we can leverage to make noise. Read through "Playing and Creating Sound" to see if anything piques your interest. Let me know if you need pointers. https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonInMusic.
